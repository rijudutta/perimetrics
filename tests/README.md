Plots for the fractional error in estimating the perimeter of a circular contour are shown above, as a function of the exponent $\alpha$ of the power-law intensity profile (*right*), and the radius R of the circle (*left*). R is measured in the number of pixels, and for our chosen intensity profile the gradient of the intensity at the edge of the circle is given by âˆ’$\alpha$/R. Our tests indicate that the fractional error in perimeter is proportional to ${\rm gradient}/R$.

Plots for the fractional error in estimating the perimeter of a circular contour are shown above, as a function of the radius R of the circle. R is measured in the number of pixels. Our tests indicate that the fractional error in perimeter is proportional to $R^{-2}$.
