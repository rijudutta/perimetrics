Plots for the fractional error in estimating the perimeter of a circular contour are shown above, as a function of the exponent $\alpha$ of the power-law intensity profile (*right*), and the radius *R* of the circle (*left*). *R* is measured in the number of pixels, and for our chosen intensity profile the gradient of the intensity at the edge of the circle is given by âˆ’*alpha*/R. Our tests indicate that the fractional error in perimeter is proportional to *gradient*/*R*.

Plots for the fractional error in estimating the filamentarity of a circular contour are shown above, as a function of the radius *R* of the circle. *R* is measured in the number of pixels. Our tests indicate that the fractional error in perimeter is proportional to *R*<sup>-2</sup>. (Expected filamentarity is 0 for a circle)
